# = Tryouts
# 
# This class has three purposes:
# * It represents the Tryouts object which is a group of Tryout objects. 
# * The tryouts and dreams DSLs are executed within its namespace. In general the 
#   class methods are the handlers for the DSL syntax (some instance getter methods 
#   are modified to support DSL syntax by acting like setters when given arguments)
# * It stores all known instances of Tryouts objects in a class variable @@instances.
